## What is this?

I'm just re-touching up on html/css and learning the Bootstrap framework. This is the first project I am doing to accomplish this! It is also for my business on my campus for mobile device repair, so I'm just killing two birds with one stone with this one. 

I'm using the Start Bootstrap theme by David Miller. (Credits in the Creator section)
I first started with the framework provided by getbootstrap.com.

## Bugs and Issues
* 6/10/2016
	- Trying to get a scrolling-blur effect to happen on the header background. So far, the close I have gotten to is bluring the ENTIRE header, including the text and the button. Still trying to figure out how to just get the background.
	-Still need to impliment a contact form (Use PHP?)
	-Integration of Instagram feed for the "Gallary" section
